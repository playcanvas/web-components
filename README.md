PlayCanvas Web Components are a set of custom HTML elements for building 3D interactive web apps. Using the declarative nature of HTML makes it both easy and fun to incorporate 3D into your website.

```html
<!-- A lit sphere -->
<pc-app>
    <pc-scene>
        <pc-entity name="camera" position="0,0,3">
            <pc-camera></pc-camera>
        </pc-entity>
        <pc-entity name="light" rotation="45,45,0">
            <pc-light></pc-light>
        </pc-entity>
        <pc-entity name="ball">
            <pc-render type="sphere"></pc-render>
        </pc-entity>
    </pc-scene>
